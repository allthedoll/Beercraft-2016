# Speaking on Hops & the Coming Year
What are hops?
- Hops are the flowers of the hop plant humulus lupulus. The pupulin glands of female hop cones contain valuable resins that are paramount in establishing the flavor and aroma of beer.

Hops in Beer
Alpha and Beta Acids
- Alpha and beta acides in these resins add the bitter character to beer.
  - High alpha: bittering
  - Low alpha: aroma

## YCH Mission
- To connect family farms with the world's finest brewers, providing the highest quality hop products and uncompromising service for the ultimate benefit of our customers, employees and growers.

- Sustainable growing and manufacturing practices

## Growing hops
- Best grown in Washington-state, Australia, New Zealand
  - Hot, sunny days and cold, crisp nights

## YCH Offerings
- Green Hops: whole, wet hop cones (not available for homebrew because they mold quickly)
  - Hard for homebrewers to buy before they go bad
- Leaf hops: whole, kiln-dried hop cones
  - Whole leaf is one-step into processing
  - No additives
  - Degrade fast
  - Difficult and space-consuming to store
- Hop Pellets: T-90 Pellets and pellet-blends
  - One more step into the process
  - Flush nitrogren on them to freeze
- Cryo Hops: Lupulin hop powder and bract fraction
  - Not really available to homebrewers yet
  - Scraped off the machinery
  - Extremely low temperatures freeze the hops and the leaves detach from the lupulin
  - Most concentrated hop product able to be produced
  - 23-25% compares to the traditional haps 3-5%
  - Super pungant 
  - Low alpha alternative that gives a full body flavor like a higher alpha hop
- Resinate: CO2 hop extract derived products
  - Not available for homebrewers yet, in the pipeline

## What's new for 2017
- HBC (Hope Breeding Company) 366 hops will be rebranding as Ekuanot under Equinox brand
  - Comfortable best-by date is 3 years, so you should be able to sell older packaging; the best-by date is statistically longer, but this is a super safe buffer
    - Store as close to freezing as possible, or at least in freezer or cold storage; <40 is minimal
    - Packaging has UV protection

- HBC 291 is rebranding to Loral
  - Newest variety release from HBC
  - Dual purpose variety with noble heritage that straddles the fence between old and new world hop aromatics.
  - Extremely versatile,  not as pungent 
  
- Footprints quality management system
  - The farmers "Footprints" are the best fertilizer in the field.
    - Site prep, varietal purity, crop management, harvest quality, food and safety traceability.
    - Basically a hand-maintained farm where someone goes through each row personally.
    - Ensures there are no cross-contaminations of different breeds of hops that were previously grown in that gfield.

- Not on the radar at the moment:
  - Hop oils
    - Actually not a big market for it
    - Prohibitive costs and time involved in that process

- Random thoughts:
  - It's  not  all about crop year, some years have better oils and alphas/betas than more recent crop years
- Brewing is a science and an artform
- Oxygen, light, and heat are the biggest threats to hops
  - Look for foil packaging to protect for light
  - Nitrogen flushed is best for freshness as it knocks out oxygen and freezes the hops
  - Avoid packaging that isn't vacuum-sealed
