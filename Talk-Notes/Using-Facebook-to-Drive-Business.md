# Using Facebook to Drive Business
Four ingredients for a succcessful digital marketing campaign:
- Clarity
- Community
- Consistency
- Creativity

- Clarity
  - The most effective post on FB is a simple caption, a clear picture, and does not mention price.
  - "Jab Jab Jab, Right Hook" marketing style book recommendation
    - Put mostly fun things, littered with some more direct marketing specials
    - Marketing should be accidental, don't pressure with sales pitches
    - Put out information, make celebrations of things (eg Hops season, have fun and celebrate beer)

- Community
  - Comment/like/share for a chance to win a ______ and then the winner follow-up post

- Consistency
  - Be regular; FB's algorythm looks at regular posts
  - Don't use FB to make unhappy annoucements (eg power's out, other posts that won't acrue many "likes")
  - When FB sees someone engaging with someone or a company's page, it is more likely to regularly show them that friend or company in their regular daily feed
  - Don't use shortcuts like HootSuite/ConstantContact to import posts because FB doesn't like when you make posts without actually "being there"
  - The FB scheduler doesn't like when you schedule a bunch of stuff and then aren't regularly active, so it's not ranked as high as "live, in the moment content"
  - The best way to get higher ranks for the above point is to use the Pages App/Pages to make live updates and posts.
  - Facebook live is cool (eg demonstrations, what's going  on right now, etc.)

- Creativity
  - Toss a joke into a marketing post (eg Smells are FREE)
  - Shout out brews and the people that make them on FB (eg send us your homebrew pics)

## Reach
Organic vs. Paid
- Find ways to engage to get more organic engagements (see community above)
- If you have more than 20% of the vertical surface area of a photo with text, it will treat the photo as an ad
- Taking photos from google searches will show as such, it recognizes photos taken from the internet (eg stolen material won't reach as many people)
- Hashtags don't do much at the present on FB unless they're already trending
- Post timings
  - 11am-1pm PDT (lunchtime)
  - 6:30-9:30pm PDT (evening)
  - Lifespan of a single post during the day is 3-5 hours
- When boosting posts, play around with the target audience settings to see how it affects the number reached
- Facebook live does well if 10-20 minutes; but it depends on the content and how good that content is

## Instagram
- If you can't post beautiful images, don't bother

## Twitter
- Better for metropolitan areas, not really used outside large cities and hard to target audience geographically
